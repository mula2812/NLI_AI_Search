# üåç National Library of Israel Search MCP

Welcome to the **National Library of Israel Model Context Protocol (NLI MCP)** - a modern AI-powered bridge for exploring millions of cultural, historical, and literary assets held by the **National Library of Israel (NLI)**.

This MCP server allows **natural language search** using **Claude**, making it easier than ever to search the NLI digital archive through conversational queries in Hebrew or English.

## ü§î Why Use This?

The NLI API is powerful but complex. It requires structured metadata-based queries that are hard to construct without technical or library-specific knowledge. This MCP bridges that gap by converting simple questions like:

> "medieval Hebrew manuscripts"

into rich API calls that return accurate and media-rich results with thumbnails, manifests, or streaming content when available.

## üìö What You Can Discover

The National Library of Israel houses an extraordinary collection including:

- **Historical Documents**: Ancient manuscripts, government records, and personal archives
- **Literary Works**: Books, poetry, and writings in multiple languages
- **Visual Materials**: Photographs, maps, illustrations, and artwork
- **Audio Collections**: Music recordings, speeches, and oral histories
- **Cultural Artifacts**: Items representing Jewish heritage and Israeli culture
- **Academic Resources**: Research materials and scholarly publications

- For example:
  > Books by Bialik published after 1920.

You'll get:

- Search results
- Metadata
- Links to items
- Images or thumbnails
- In some cases, streaming content or IIIF resources

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting & FAQ

**üîß Plugin not appearing?**

- Ensure Claude Desktop is ‚â• v2.0 and you restarted after install.
- Ensure that the installation package or project is located **only in a path that contains English characters**.

**üí¨ MCP isn't responding. What should I do?**

- Make sure you installed it correctly. You should see in search and tools the "nli_mcp" addition.

- Ensure you enable all the "nli_mcp" inside options (from the search and tools options).

- Check your internet connection and firewall settings.

- Review the logs for any error messages.

**üîë "Invalid API key" error**

As a default visitor key is installed to your computer using the bat or bash file, which allows basic access to the library data.

1. Double-check the NLI_API_KEY environment variable, to ensure it installed correctly.
2. Another option is to create your own free KEY:
   Obtaining a personal API key is not essential for the project's initial function, as mentioned. However, if you want to get full access to all the data and capabilities the National Library offers, it is highly recommended to register and get your own API key.

- Visit the National Library of Israel's Open Library API documentation Open Library API ([click](https://api2.nli.org.il/signup/)).
- Follow the instructions to register and get your API key. You may need to contact the National Library for access.
